        <h1>THE LION KING</h1>
        <h2>In the African savanna, a lion named Simba is born to King Mufasa and Queen Sarabi. All the animals gather to celebrate, because Simba is the future king of the Pride Lands.

Mufasa teaches Simba important lessons about life and responsibility, explaining that everything is connected in the Circle of Life. Simba is brave and curious, but also young and careless.

Mufasa’s brother Scar is jealous because he wants to be king. He plans a terrible betrayal. Scar tricks Simba into going to a gorge, then causes a wildebeest stampede. Mufasa rushes in to save Simba but is killed when Scar throws him off a cliff.

Scar convinces Simba that the tragedy was his fault. Heartbroken and afraid, Simba runs away from the Pride Lands.

Far away, Simba meets two funny and kind friends, Timon the meerkat and Pumbaa the warthog. They teach him to live without worries, following their motto: “Hakuna Matata.” Simba grows up, trying to forget his past.

One day, Simba meets Nala, his childhood friend, who tells him the Pride Lands are suffering under Scar’s rule. With the help of Rafiki, the wise baboon, Simba realizes he cannot run from who he truly is.

Simba returns home to face Scar. After a fierce battle, Scar’s lies are exposed, and he is defeated. Peace returns to the Pride Lands.

Simba takes his rightful place as king, restoring balance to the Circle of Life. The story ends as it began—with new life and hope for the future.

<h1>MUFASA : THE LION KING </h1>
<h2>Mufasa was not born a king. As a young cub, he was separated from his parents during a terrible flood and left alone in the wild. Scared but brave, Mufasa struggled to survive on his own.

He was eventually found by another young lion named Taka, a prince of a royal pride (who would later become Scar). Taka’s family took Mufasa in, raising him alongside their own son. Though Mufasa was an outsider, he grew strong, kind, and noble.

As they grew up, Mufasa proved himself through courage, wisdom, and selflessness. He protected others, stood up to danger, and always thought of the pride before himself. The animals respected him—not because of his bloodline, but because of his heart.

Over time, jealousy grew in Taka. While Mufasa earned admiration naturally, Taka felt overshadowed. This jealousy slowly turned into bitterness and resentment.

When great threats came to the Pride Lands, Mufasa stepped forward as a leader. Through bravery and sacrifice, he earned the trust of the lions and the blessing of the land itself. In the end, Mufasa was chosen to be king, not by birth, but by destiny.

As king, Mufasa ruled with strength and compassion. He protected the Circle of Life and taught that a true king does not seek power—but serves others. He later became a father to Simba, passing on his wisdom and values.

Though Mufasa’s life ended tragically, his spirit never left. His lessons lived on in Simba, and his voice echoed in the skies, reminding his son that a true king lives on through those he inspires.</h2>
